<h1>The Great Sock Disappearance Mystery</h1>

<p>Every laundry day, a sock vanishes without a trace.<br /> Where do they go? A secret sock society? A portal behind the dryer? No one knows.<br />  But one thing's for sure — somewhere out there is a pile of unmatched socks living their best solo lives.</p>

    <li>They get stuck inside bedsheets or pant legs.</li>
    <li>They’re accidentally thrown away.</li>
    <li>They escape into another dimension through a hidden sock portal.</li>
</ol>
